# churn_prediction

### Summary : ###

Utilized data preprocessing, various models (logistic regression, KNN, XGBoost, RF, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree), and validation techniques (cross-validation, GridSearchCV) for proactive churn management.

### Solution : ###
The project utilized a comprehensive approach, combining preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and multiple predictive models to accurately forecast customer churn. Leveraging a range of algorithms and thorough validation, the solution provides a reliable framework for identifying potential churn, aiding businesses in proactively retaining customers.

In short among, logistic regression, KNN, XGBoost, RF, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree models, logistic regression came victorious.


### Approach : ###

1. Data Prep: Explored, cleaned and encoded data.
2. Scaling: Standardized numeric features.
3. Feature Analysis: Identified key predictors using Random Forest.
4. Assessment: Analyzed churn with visualization, correlation matrices and VIF plots.
5. Modeling: Employed logistic regression,KNN, XGBoost, RF, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.
6. Validation: Used cross-validation, GridSearchCV for model selection.
7. Impact: Provided businesses a proactive churn management tool for enhanced performance.
